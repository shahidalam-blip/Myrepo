To get a company flat in Jamshedpur as a non-employee, you would typically need to follow a specific procedure. Please note that the process may vary depending on the company and its policies. Here are some general steps you can take:

Identify the companies offering housing facilities: Research and identify companies in Jamshedpur that provide company flats or housing facilities to non-employees. This information can usually be found on the company's website or by contacting their HR department.

Contact the company: Reach out to the HR department or the concerned department responsible for managing company housing. Inquire about their policies regarding the availability of flats for non-employees.

Check eligibility criteria: Understand the eligibility criteria for non-employees to be considered for a company flat. Some companies may prioritize employees and their families, while others may offer flats to non-employees as well. Clarify any specific requirements, such as being associated with the company as a contractor, consultant, or other professional role.

Submit an application: If you meet the eligibility criteria, submit an application for the company flat. This may involve completing an application form and providing supporting documents, such as identification proof, address proof, and any other documents specified by the company.

Await confirmation: After submitting your application, the company will review it and assess the availability of flats. They may consider factors such as demand, availability, and your specific circumstances. You might have to wait for a response to know whether a flat is available and if you have been selected.

Sign a lease agreement: If your application is accepted, you will be required to sign a lease agreement. This document outlines the terms and conditions of your tenancy, including rent, duration, and other relevant details. Carefully review the agreement and seek legal advice if needed before signing.

Pay security deposit and rent: Before moving into the company flat, you will typically be required to pay a security deposit and any upfront rent as per the agreement. Ensure you understand the payment terms and fulfill the financial requirements.

Move-in and adhere to policies: Once all the formalities are completed, you can move into the company flat. Familiarize yourself with any rules or policies related to the use of the flat, maintenance responsibilities, and other guidelines specified by the company.

Remember that the availability and process for obtaining a company flat as a non-employee can vary from one company to another. It's essential to directly contact the companies you are interested in for accurate and up-to-date information.
